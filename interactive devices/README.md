# Task 2 - Stylized Abstract Design
## Hardware
The device is comprised of the Raspberry Pi, an ESP32, a breadboard, a momentary switch, a toggle switch, an analog joystick, and a 5" LCD display screen.
## Setup
The program to draw the abstract designs is titled main.py. The ESP32 should have test.ino uploaded onto it so main.py can receive input information through pyserial. The program can be run directly on the Raspberry Pi as a python script. Pyserial must be downloaded as a module. The Raspberry Pi will also need Arduinon IDE set up on it to be able to detect and parse information from the ESP32.
