'Carousel of Animals' is a standing sculpture meant to be a mini carousel. It has a white theme and various miniature animal sculptures on it. The animal sculptures are removable and customizable. Turning on the carousel by flipping the switch will start the carousels rotations as well as the changing color light. 

It is composed of two servo motors (originally one servo one stepper), ESP32, AC wall adapter, RGB Cathode LED, and a switch. 
The program uses code in Arduino to control the motors, switch, and light.
